            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This is my university final year project. Basically I created a simulation program in MATLAB. It simulates a theoretical
                scenario where consumers can buy electricity from each other, assuming consumers have the ability to generate energy
                (e.g solar panel) and becomes a prosumer. The energy transaction is facilitated by the double auction algorithm, the same algorithm
                used in stock trading (correct me if im wrong). The inputs for the algorithm are each prosumer's and consumer's future electricity
                generation and usage data and price to buy and sell. So ideally there's a predictive model that can provide those data. However
                in this project I used data that are randomized within a range that is representative of some dataset.
            </p>
            <p>The simulation is divided into 4 MATLAB scripts. One script is somewhat the "dashboard", where all the input data and configuration
                is made. Then there's the script to do data cleaing. The third one runs the double auction algorithm and the last do data processing.
                I spent a lot of time working on the data processing script and honestly I'm quite proud. It's sorta modular, I can practically 
                "turn on and off" any of the functions, depending on what analysis I wanna do. Adding new functions is also relatively much easier.
                I'm not sure why I made it that way, because I definitely didn't need it. It would've been much faster if I wrote it in a 
                non-modular way. But I guess I did it to anticipate if there're further analysis that needed to be done.
            </p>
            <p>One of my professor asked on why I decided to use MATLAB. First of all we had the license. Secondly, since it's about energy trading,
                I was thinking that if I ever work on continuing that project, I would love to integrate it to an actual microgrid model. One
                feature that would be useful is MATLAB's Simulink. Hence why I made it in MATLAB, for future "expansions".
